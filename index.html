                    <p>My name is Maya Lierz and I’m in 3rd grade.  I live in Omaha Nebraska with my mom, my dad and my sister, Harper.  I have many friends at school and in my neighborhood.  My grandparents live in my same neighborhood, just one street over.
                    Sometimes my sister and I go there after school if mom and dad are not home.  It’s nice living so close to grandparents because we get to see them a lot and we don’t have any other babysitter.
                    My grandparents have a black (standard size) poodle named Claude.  We have a golden retriever named Apollo.  Apollo and Claude get along really well.  My favorite things to do are read, play with friends and watch movies.
                     Some of my favorite books are the Harry Potter series and Wings of Fire.  I also like to play the piano. I am learning Fur Elise right now.</p>

                <p>This past year I went to Colorado and Mexico on vacation.  In Colorado we did lots of skiing at Winter Park and in Mexico we did a lot of swimming in the pool and the beach.
                I love to ski and am really good at it.  I can do blue slopes and moguls.  This summer we are going to Portland, Maine to visit friends and to Ithaca New York  to visit my aunt, uncle and twin cousins.
                I’m excited to go on a trip to the East part of the United States.</p>

            <img src="images/mayaClassroom.jpg" alt="dolphin" class="align-left" /><p>I enjoy school very much.  My favorite subjects are reading and writing.  The school I go to is called Prairie Queen (PQ) and it opened 2 years ago.
                I went to Kindergarten at a different school and then transferred to PQ.  My sister, Harper is 6 years old and in Kindergarten at PQ.  We both take the bus to and from school.  Our bus driver’s name is Brandon.
                We like Brandon because he lets us eat candy and listen to music, he hooks the bus stereo up to his phone and plays our requests. I am in a special math group where we are learning to balance equations.  I recently participated in a district
                wide math competition where my team came in second place.</p>

            <div id = "Golden Retriever Rescue">
                <p>As a family we do volunteer work for Golden Retriever Rescue in Nebraska <a href="http://www.grrin.org" target="_blank">(GRRIN.org)</a>.  We often foster dogs that are surrendered.  Because our own dog is 13, we usually get senior dogs.
                    Even though they are old, they are still lots of fun to take care of.  I’m always a little sad when they go to their forever home but then I get excited again because I know another foster dog is right
                    around the corner.  Below are some pictures of dogs we have fostered that are extra special to me:</p>
